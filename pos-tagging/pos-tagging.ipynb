        "How to determine the number of blank characters we need? The calculation of MAX_WORD_LEN is here for help (which we already provide in the starter code). For the given sentence, MAX_WORD_LEN equals 4. Therefore we prepend two blank characters to \"We\", zero blank character to \"love\", and one blank character to \"NLP\". So the resultant padded sentence we get should be [\"  We\", \"love\", \" NLP\"].\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we feed all characters in [\"  We\", \"love\", \" NLP\"] into a char-embedding layer, and get a tensor of shape (3, 4, char_embedding_dim). To make this tensor's shape proper for the char-level LSTM (nn.LSTM), we need to transpose this tensor, i.e. swap the first and the second dimension. So we get a tensor of shape (4, 3, char_embedding_dim), where 4 corresponds to seq_len and 3 corresponds to batch_size.\n",
        "\n",
        "The last thing you need to do is to obtain the last hidden state from the char-level LSTM, and concatenate it with the word embedding, so that you can get an augmented representation of that word.\n",

        "[This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaojiang06/chaojiang06.github.io/master/TA/spring2022_CS4650/char_padding.png) is an illustration for left padding characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why doing the padding?\n",
        "Someone may ask why we want to do such a kind of padding, instead of directly passing each of the character sequences of each word one by one through an LSTM, to get the last hidden state. The reason is that if you don't do padding, then that means you can only implement this process using \"for loop\". For CharPOSTagger, if you implement it using \"for loop\", the training time would be approximately 150s (GPU) / 250s (CPU) per epoch, while it would be around 30s (GPU) / 150s (CPU) per epoch if you do the padding and feed your data in batches. Therefore, we strongly recommend you learn how to do the padding and transform your data into batches. In fact, those are quite important concepts which you should get yourself familar with, although it might take you some time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why doing left padding?\n",
        "Our hypothesis is that the suffixes of English words (e.g., -ly, -ing, etc) are more indicative than prefixes for the part-of-speech (POS). Though LSTM is supposed to be able to handle long sequences, it still lose information along the way and the information closer to the last state (which you use as char-level representations) will be retained better. \n",
        "\n",
        "### How to understand the dimention change?\n",
        "Assume we have got a sentence with 3 words [\"We\", \"love\", \"NLP\"], and assume the dimension of character embedding is 2, the dimension of word embedding is 4, the dimension of word-level LSTM's hidden layer is 5, the dimension of character-level LSTM's hidden layer is 6.\n",
